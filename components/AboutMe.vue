                Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest,
                you'll have more fun. Whoa, this guy's straight? It's a hug,
                Michael. I'm hugging you. Well, what do you expect, mother? I'm
                afraid I just blue myself.

                Guy's a pro. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. I don't
                criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes
                a diet is the best defense. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You
                drank it fast enough.

                It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in
                life. I've opened a door here that I regret. Marry me. Guy's a
                pro.
